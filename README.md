# Block Cloudflare MITM Attack

**Pull requests are welcome!**

The purpose of this browser add-on is to block Cloudflare sites.

The TLS protocol promises end-to-end encryption between the client and an authenticated, identified endpoint server.  The browser’s lock icon is a UI widget which makes this promise to the user.  Cloudflare is a mass-decryption chokepoint, which intercepts and decrypts the Web requests made by billions of people to millions of websites.
